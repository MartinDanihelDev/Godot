func point_direction(vector_a, vector_b):
#	This custom function in Godot provides a way to determine the direction in degrees between two vectors, 
#	similar to the point_direction function in GameMaker Language (GML). The result will be returned in the range of 0-360, 
#	allowing the user to easily determine the direction between the two vectors. This function can be useful for tasks such as aiming, 
#	movement, and collision detection in Godot, and can help users who are transitioning from GameMaker to Godot.

	degrees = abs(degrees - 360);
